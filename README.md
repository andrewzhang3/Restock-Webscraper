# eCommerce-Restock-Scraper

Originally made for my girlfriend to check when item restocked, as the sites own notification service did not work.

Contains 2 txt files and 1 web scraping script.
1. Replace the url in function execute_scrape() with desired url for product you want to check.
2. Make sure to reconfigure the file path to wherever you want it.
3. Use inspect element on product page to find element you want to check and write it in.
4. Edit in your own email aswell.
